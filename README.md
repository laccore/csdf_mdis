### Hello

At present, this repo only contains a user manual for the CSDF customized version of mDIS.

### Usage

The HTML manual is compiled from the Markdown file `manual.md` using [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it),
a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package. Install with

`npm install -g markdown-it`

A VS Code build task is provided to compile `manual.md` to `compiled_manual.html`. In the Terminal menu, choose Run Build Task, then choose Compile Markdown.
